Set in the ground of this miniature clearing are a number of mounds of upturned earth. Just as you begin to ponder the situation, one of the hills erupts in a shower of saturated dirt and pebbles. When the dust settles there is small, hairless creature sat astride the newly burrowed hole. Regarding you with small, beady eyes, it raises itself onto its haunches and nervously flicks its disproportionately enormous ears towards its other surroundings.",

Just as the sensation of finally being out of the direct light sets in, you notice a strange looking growth protruding from one of the low-hanging tree branches ahead. It seems to be some kind of fruit, but on closer inspection it appears foreign and warped, its edges ridged with gnarled thorns; some manner of thick, brown fluid appears to be leaking from its centre.",
